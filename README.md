# Bangalore-Housing-Price-Prediction
- I have implement a Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. 
- This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc.
- Data was collected from Kaggle.
- Data shape is 13320 rows and 9 columns.
- Second step was to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
- Third component was the website built in HTML, CSS and javascript that allows user to enter home location, total square feet, bath, size etc and 
it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
